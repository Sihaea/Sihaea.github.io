                <p class="text">Flow is a psychological state of optimal performance characterised by intense focus,
                    seamless execution, and a distorted sense of time. Originating from the work of Mihaly
                    Csikszentmihalyi, flow is a proven enhancer of skill acquisition and creativity.

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Project Outline:</h3>
                <p class="text">The following project investigates how flow can be stimulated and applied in language
                    learning through the combined use of a gameified language learning app, an adaptive deep learning
                    model, and tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) technology. The goal is to
                    create a system that dynamically responds to user metrics, sustaining flow and enhancing
                    language acquisition.

                <p class="text">
                    Engagement with the flow-state has been shown to enhance cognitive performance and learning outcomes.
                    Several modern studies have utilised tDCS to stimulate flow in the brain.<span class="small-br"></span>
                    • A 2021 study found a 1.5 mA cathodal right and anodal left stimulation of the dorsolateral
                    prefrontal cortex resulted in greater language recall in foreign language learning participants.
                    (Bolling et al., 2021)
                    <span class="small-br"></span>
                    • Another successful study quantifying flow applied deep learning techniques to metrics
                    obtained from students in an e-learning environment. (Semerci & Goularas, 2020)

                    Thinking Cap could inform the design and direction of future learning applications, not exclusive to
                    language learning - There could be a future where Flow-Assisted Language Learning applications are
                    commonplace!

                <p class="text">
                    Flow is colloquially referred to as being 'in the zone' or, 'locked in', and several characteristics
                    associated with the state have been identified (Nakamura & Csikszentmihalyi, 2002, p. 90):<span class="small-br"></span>
                    • <i>Intense concentration</i><span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Loss of self-consciousness</i><span
                        class="small-br"></span>• <i>A distorted sense of time</i>.
                    <span class="small-br"></span>
                    Also recognised were several features required for the initiation of flow:
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>A balance of high challenge and high skill</i>
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Clear and immediate feedback on a task</i>
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>A sense of control over the task</i>.
                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Deep Learning Model</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    A 2020 study by Semerci & Goularas employed a deep learning model to quantitatively measure flow in
                    students engaged in an e-learning website. The study used skill vs. challenge from the theory of
                    flow, and derived activity vs. performance as metrics. Activity was calculated from the following
                    (Semerci & Goularas, 2020):
                    <br></br>• <i>Total amount of time a student spent after logging in</i>
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Total amount of time a student performed mouse actions</i>
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>The number of mouse click actions taken by a student</i>.
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>The number of in-application-locations visited by a student</i>.
                    <br></br> Performance was derived from quiz scores.
                    <br></br> The Activity data was collected and converted into heatmaps, in order to show where on the
                    screen a student is most active.
                    <br></br> a CAE (Convolutional Autoencoder) was then used to understand the heatmaps in the following steps:
                    <br></br>• <i>Encoder: Downsizes the heatmap into a summary</i>
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Decoder: Mirrors the encoder with up-sampling layers to
                    reconstruct the input, maintaining the most important features</i>.
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Result: A feature vector representing a student's activity</i>.
                    <br></br> The Activity vector of each student is compared to an 'Expert' vector - the vector of the
                    most efficient and highest performing student.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-subtitle">tDCS Technology and a Neuroscience-based theory of flow</h3>
                <p class="text">
                    Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation technology can enhance or inhibit areas of the brain via anodal and/or cathodal
                    charges, respectively. The technology has many applications in the field of neuroscience, and has
                    been used to verify the Transient Hypofrontality Hypothesis (THH), a neuroscientific approach to a
                    theory of flow (Dietrich, 2004). <br></br>
                    THH posits flow as a down-regulation of the prefrontal cortex which allows external processes to
                    shift from explicit ot implicit knowledge, thus enabling flow.
                    <br></br><i>Prefrontal Cortex: Area of brain governing self-consciousness and explicit processing.</i>
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Explicit process: An activity requiring conscious recollection of how it is done.</i>.
                    <span class="small-br"></span>• <i>Implicit process: An activity which is unconscious.</i>.
                    <br></br>
                    A study by Gold and Ciorciari (2019) achieved flow and found evidence for THH in a video-game based
                    activity by applying anodal stimulation of the right parietal lobe (non-verbal memory) and cathodal
                    stimulation of the left frontal lobe (deactivating the medial prefrontal cortex to
                    promote faster transitions of novel information from explicit to implicit knowledge)
                    <br></br>
                    A similar study which inverted the anodal and cathodal stimulation achieved flow and greater
                    language recall in left-handed foreign language learners (Bolling et al., 2021).

                    <i>Balance of Challenge and Skill</i>:
                    <span class="small-br"></span>
                    • Users of Thinking Cap, the flow-assisted language learning (FALL) app, will first perform a calibration
                    quiz in their target foreign-language, in order to measure their current level of skill, and begin
                    calculating an optimal level of challenge.<span class="small-br"></span>
                    • As a user plays, the FALL app will adjust its content (task type, difficulty, frequency) according
                    to the deep learning algorithm.<span class="small-br"></span>
                    • A deep learning model will create a heatmap of user Activity based on a set of metrics similar to
                    the study by Semerci & Goularas, however adjusted for mobile-compatibility
                    (taps instead of clicks etc..)<span class="small-br"></span>
                    • The deep learning model will compare the resultant vector (Activity + Accuracy) to an
                    'Expert' - a vector of optimal performance adjusted to their skill level, which a user should be
                    performing at should they be in a state of flow. As the skill level of the user increases, the
                    'Expert' is updated accordingly.<br></br>
                    <i>Clear and Immediate Feedback</i>:
                    <span class="small-br"></span>
                    • The app informs the user immediately of any errors or successes, and should an error occur, the
                    user is also informed of what went wrong.<br></br>
                    <i>A Sense of Control Over the Task</i>:
                    <span class="small-br"></span>
                    • The user is given autonomy over which styles of learning they are doing, whether it be reading,
                    listening or speaking; and within those categories the type of task is chosen by the user, e.g.
                    reading comprehension, vocab memorisation, fill-in-the-gap etc.

                </p>

                <p class="text">
                    • During play, a user wears a user-friendly tDCS adjusted to 1.5 mA, as this was the electrical
                    current found most effective in Bolling et al. (2021). The purpose of the tDCS is to speed up the
                    transition of explicit to implicit knowledge, thus speeding up language learning.
                    <span class="small-br"></span>
                    • The tDCS applies cathodal stimulation to the left frontal lobe, and anodal stimulation to the right
                    parietal lobe, as in Gold and Ciorciari (2019). Should the user be left-handed, the anodal and
                    cathodal stimulation is swapped.

                    variables.<br></br>
                    • Control Experiment: Language learning is tested on a version of the app which does not utilise the
                    deep learning model, and no tDCS is used.<br></br>
                    • No tDCS: Language learning is tested with the deep learning model, however no tDCS is used.<br></br>
                    • No Deep Learning Model: Language learning is tested without the deep learning model but with the tDCS<br></br>
                    • Both: Language learning is tested with both the deep learning model and tDCS.<br></br>
                    In each experiment a pre-test, post-test and delayed post-test on language-retention are used to measure effectiveness
